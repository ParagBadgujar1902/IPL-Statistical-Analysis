## 📈 Key Analyses
This project utilizes both **graphical** and **statistical** techniques to analyze the IPL dataset.

### 1️⃣ Graphical Analysis
Visualizations were created to explore various aspects of the league:

- **Matches per Venue:** Identified *Eden Gardens* as the venue that hosted the most matches.  
- **Team Performance:** Analyzed the total matches played and won by each team — *Mumbai Indians* played and won the most matches.  
- **Man of the Match (MoM):** Identified the top 5 players with the most MoM awards — *AB de Villiers* leads the list.  
- **Top Batsmen:** Ranked the top 10 batsmen by total runs scored — *Virat Kohli* ranks first.  
- **Dismissal Kinds:** Found that *‘caught’* is the most common form of dismissal.

### 2️⃣ Statistical Technique: Chi-Square Test
A **Chi-Square Test for Independence** was performed to examine associations between categorical variables.

#### 🔹 Toss vs. Match Result
- The impact of the toss decision was found to be **independent** of the match result.  
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) **was not rejected**.  
- *p-value = 0.533 > 0.05*

#### 🔹 Home Ground vs. Match Result
- The impact of home conditions was found to be **independent** of the match result.  
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) **was not rejected**.  
- *p-value = 0.365 > 0.05*
